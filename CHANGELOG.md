## [5.1.1] - 2018-12-04
### Fixed
* Fixed a bug where using the `--for_public_consumption` `compile` argument would include documentation that was vendor tag-bound. [5d417f0](https://github.com/erunion/mill/commit/5d417f07b2dcdda3d8264c9556d9c4ee7ef63cfb)

## [5.1.0] - 2018-12-04
### Added

* The [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
* Human-friendly schema names are now compiled into the `schemas` section in OpenAPI specs. [#201](https://github.com/erunion/mill/pull/201)
* `@api-data` annotations now support `required` and `optional` flags for signaling that that piece of data is expected to always be returned in the response. The default behavior is for the annotation to be `required`. Signaling something as optional is opt-in and requires the `optional` flag. [#203](https://github.com/erunion/mill/pull/203), [#204](https://github.com/erunion/mill/issues/204)

* A new `environment` attribute on `server` config entries. [#177](https://github.com/erunion/mill/pull/177)

* Added additional relevant data to request parameters in JSON-generated changelogs. [#107](https://github.com/erunion/mill/issues/107)

* Subtypes are now being properly converted to API Blueprint-compatible types during API Blueprint compilation. [#147](https://github.com/erunion/mill/issues/147)
